## Embedded Framework Installation

### Manual Installation Steps

1. Download/clone/submodule the latest [`AzureCommunicationUICalling`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-communication-ui-library-ios) Library to your project root directory.
2. Open your existing iOS application Xcode project in `xcworkspace`.
3. Drag the `AzureCommunicationUICalling.xcodeproj` from the newly added subfolder path `/AzureCommunicationUI/sdk/AzureCommunicationUICalling` into your Xcode project's `xcworkspace`.
4. Select your application project in the Xcode Navigator, and open the target that you want to import Mobile UI Library.
5. Open the "General" panel and click on the `+` button under the "Frameworks and Libraries" section.
6. Select `AzureCommunicationUICalling.framework` and then you can `import AzureCommunicationUICalling` inside your project to use Mobile UI Library.
7. Follow the [Other Dependencies Installation](#other-dependencies-installation) section to include all dependencies in your project. 
8. Select project `AzureCommunicationUICalling.xcodeproj` in your workspace, open the target and scroll to the "Frameworks and Libraries" section, link dependent frameworks `libFluentUI.a`, `AzureCommunicationCalling` and `AzureCommunicationCommon`. Update the frameworks to `Do Not Embed` for reducing the app size purpose.

#### How to fix the issues

- **Buildtime issue: 'unable to open file(...)' - 'Pods-AzureCommunicationUICalling.debug.xcconfig...'**

    Navigate to the project `AzureCommunicationUICalling.xcodeproj` in Xcode, delete the whole folder `Pods` with red name. 
    
- **Buildtime issue: 'Framework not found Pods_AzureCommunicationUICalling.'**
    
    1. Select Navigator and navigate to the target `AzureCommunicationUICalling`.
    2. Delete the `Pods_AzureCommunicationUICalling.framework` under "Frameworks and Libraries" section. 
    
- **Buildtime issue: 'The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock.'**
    
    1. Select Navigator and navigate to the target `AzureCommunicationUICalling` and choose `Build Phases`.
    2. Delete the script `[CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock`.

### Other Dependencies Installation

Azure Communication Mobile UI Library requires a few dependencies. Please embed the following libraries into your project if you prefer manually embedding Mobile UI Library. And you can refer from each library's Podspec file for the required source files.

#### 1. [AzureCommunicationCalling](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/main/sdk/communication/AzureCommunicationCalling) version require: [2.2.1](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/releases/tag/v2.2.1)
- Drag the `AzureCommunicationCalling.xcframework` into your project. Add it as embedded framework in your target's "Frameworks and Libraries" section. 

#### 2. [AzureCommunicationCommon](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/main/sdk/communication/AzureCommunicationCommon) - version [1.1.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/releases/tag/AzureCommunicationCommon_1.1.0)
- Find the project [AzureCommunicationCommon.xcodeproj](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/tree/main/sdk/communication/AzureCommunicationCommon) in the repo source code and drag it into your project. 
- Follow [same steps 1-6](#manual-installation-steps) of embedding `AzureCommunicationUICalling` and add `AzureCommunicationCommon` to your project.

- **Buildtime issue: 'framework not found AzureCore'**

    1. Select Navigator and navigate to the target `AzureCommunicationCommon`.
    2. Delete the `AzureCore.framework` under "Frameworks and Libraries" section. 
    
- **Buildtime issue: 'Swift Compiler Error'**

    1. Update the source code based on the error. 
    2. Select Navigator and navigate to the target `AzureCommunicationCommon` and choose `Build Phases`.
    3. Delete the script `Format And Lint`. 
    
#### 3. [MicrosoftFluentUI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple) - version [0.3.9](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple/releases/tag/0.3.9_main_0.3) 
- Follow this [Manual Installation Instruction](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple#manual-installation) to embed the `libFluentUI.a` in your target's "Frameworks and Libraries" section.

- **Runtime Crash With Fatal Error: 'FluentUI resource bundle is not found'**

    1. Select Navigator and navigate to the target `FluentUI.xcodeproj`, open the folder `Products` and you will see the `FluentUIResources-ios.bundle`. Right Click it and `Show in Finder` to find the bundle source in your finder. 
    2. Select your own project and the target import FluentUI. Go to tab `Building Phases` and drag the `FluentUIResources-ios.bundle` to the `Copy Bundle Resources` section. 
    3. Apply same update to the main target in the `AzureCommunicationUICalling.xcodeproj`, by adding the `FluentUIResources-ios.bundle` to the `Copy Bundle Resources` section.

    1. Update your target scheme with `ENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER = YES`. For more instruction, please visit [How do you enable Clang Address Sanitizer in Xcode?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32150924/how-do-you-enable-clang-address-sanitizer-in-xcode). 
    
### FAQ
#### How to conditionally use the UI library based on the iOS version when the project has a lower minimum deployment target?
The UI library won't work for devices lower than iOS 14 but it's still possible to import the UI library with the following workaround and then conditionally launch the UI library when iOS 14 is available. 

1. Add a framework to your projectâ€™s target and set the minimum deployment target > iOS 14. 
	* Use this framework for all needed dependencies imported through Cocoapods or manual embed.
	* Create an UI library Wrapper only targeted for the framework. The UI library Wrapper could be an UIViewController as the simplest example. 
	* Import needed dependency modules inside the UI library Wrapper, add `tokenCredential`, `callCompositeOptions`, and code in the `init()` method to launch the UI library. 
	* Set the UI library Wrapper as the `NSPrincipalClass` for the newly added framework. 
	* If needed, the principal class could play a complex role by implementing the shared protocol between the main target and the newly added framework. 
2. Drag the newly added framework into your main target's "Frameworks and Libraries" section with `Embed and Sign`.
3. In main app, use the [`Loadable Bundles in Cocoa`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingCode/Concepts/CocoaBundles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001269-BAJCIAHA) to load the UI library Wrapper from the newly added framework when the iOS 14 is available. Code example:
```
if #available(iOS 14.0, *) {
    if let principleClass = Bundle(identifier: "com.****.UILibraryFramework")?.principalClass as? UIViewController.Type {
        let controller = principleClass()
        self.addChild(controller)
        view.addSubview(controller.view)
    }
}
```
