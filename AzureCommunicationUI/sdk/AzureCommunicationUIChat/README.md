For detailed instructions to quickly integrate the UI Library functionalities visit the [Quick-start Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/ui-library/get-started-chat-ui-library?tabs=kotlin&pivots=platform-ios).

## Installation

### Requirements

- iOS 14+
- Xcode 13+
- Swift 5.0+

### Using CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager. To set up with CocoaPods visit their [Getting Started Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). To integrate UI Mobile Library into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'AzureCommunicationUIChat', '1.0.0-beta.3'
```

## Quick Sample

The Chat Composite requires two objects to work together, the adapter and the view.
The `ChatAdapter` requires a communication identifier, token credential, a thread id, end point url of the chat, and an optional display name.  
The `ChatCompositeView` is a SwiftUI view object that developers use to add to their View. It is initialized with the above adapter that you created.

```swift
let identifier = UnknownIdentifier(<ACS_IDENTIFIER>)
let communicationTokenCredential = try! CommunicationTokenCredential(token: <USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>)
self.chatAdapter = ChatAdapter(endpoint: <CHAT_ENDPOINT>,
                                 identifier: identifier,
                                 credential: communicationTokenCredential,
                                 threadId: <CHAT_THREAD_ID>,
                                 displayName: <DISPLAY_NAME>)
self.chatAdapter.connect() { _ in
    print("Chat connect completionHandler called")
}
let chatView = ChatCompositeView(with: chatAdapter)
```
