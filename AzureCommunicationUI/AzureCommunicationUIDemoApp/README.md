# UI Mobile Library Demo App 

The sample app is a native iOS application developed using both SwiftUI and UIKit frameworks. It uses the Azure Communication UI library to empower the user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A Mac running [Xcode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=266532), along with a valid developer certificate installed into your Keychain. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) must also be installed to fetch dependencies.
- A deployed Communication Services resource. Create a [Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
- Azure Communication Services Token. [See example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).
- (Optional) Create Azure Communication Services Token service URL. [See example](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/tutorials/trusted-service-tutorial).


### Before running the sample for the first time

1. After cloning the [Repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-communication-ui-library-ios) in your local environment, `cd` to the `AzureCommunicationUI` folder in the root of the project directory.
2. Run `pod install`, this generates a `.xcworkspace` file.
3. (Optional) cd to the <project_folder>/AzureCommunicationUI/AzureCommunicationUIDemoApp/Sources folder.
4. (Optional) Run `touch EnvConfig.xcconfig` via the Command Line. 
5. (Optional) Add constants from following list to `EnvConfig.xcconfig` as the sample app's local configurations. 
   - Shared:
      - `acsToken`: a generated Azure Communication Services token
      - `acsTokenUrl`: the URL to request Azure Communication Services token (You must use https:/$()/ in the format of URL)
      - `displayName`: your preferred display name
   - for Calling:
      - `expiredAcsToken`: an expired Azure Communication Services token for UI testing
      - `groupCallId`: this a type of UUID used to start and join a meeting for Calling
      - `teamsMeetingLink`: the URL to a Teams meeting (You must use https:/$()/ in the format of URL) for Calling
      - `aadToken`: the AAD token for Calling

    Note: The `EnvConfig.xcconfig` file is created strictly for developers convenience. Those configurations can be input once the `AzureCommunicationUIDemoApp` is running.

### Run Sample

1. Open `AzureCommunicationUI.xcworkspace` file generated in the above step.
2. Select `AzureCommunicationUIDemoApp` scheme and target at any iOS simulator/device.
3. Hit `Run` or `âŒ˜+R` to start running.
