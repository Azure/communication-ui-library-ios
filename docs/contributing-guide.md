## 1. Setup and Run Samples 
### Setup Environment

1. Begin by cloning the [Repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-communication-ui-library-ios) in your local environment, `cd` to the `AzureCommunicationUI` folder in the root of the project directory.
2. Run `pod install`, this generates a `.xcworkspace` file.
3. Open `AzureCommunicationUI.xcworkspace` file generated in the above step.
4. Hit `⌘+R` to start running.

### Running a Sample

For details on development guidelines and instructions on how to build and run the samples, visit the [Demo App](../AzureCommunicationUI/AzureCommunicationUIDemoApp/README.md).

## 2. Submitting a PR

You can send pull requests to fix the open issues. For any pull request, it's recommended to open an issue and reach an agreement on an implementation design/plan with other contributors first.

We recommend making small and simple pull requests. Avoid making the implementation complicated when there is a simple, small alternative.

Please fork the repository and submit pull requests to `develop/beta` branch. For details on how to set up a fork of this repository and keep it up-to-date see [Fork a Repo - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
