Azure Communication [UI Mobile Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/ui-library/ui-library-overview) is an Azure Communication Services capability focused on providing UI components for common business-to-consumer and business-to-business calling interactions.

## Getting Started

Get started with Azure Communication Services by using the UI Library to integrate communication experiences into your applications. For detailed instructions to quickly integrate the UI Library functionalities visit the [Quick-start Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/ui-library/get-started-call?tabs=kotlin&pivots=platform-ios).

### Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* A Mac running [Xcode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=266532), along with a valid developer certificate installed into your Keychain. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) must also be installed to fetch dependencies.
* A deployed Communication Services resource. Create a [Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
* Azure Communication Services Token. [See example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/identity/quick-create-identity).

### Installation

#### Requirements

* iOS 14+
* Xcode 13+
* Swift 5.0+

#### Using CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To set up with CocoaPods visit their [Getting Started Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). To integrate UI Mobile Library into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'AzureCommunicationUICalling', '1.0.0'
```

#### Manual Installation


If you prefer importing Mobile UI Library as an Embedded Framework to your project, please visit our [Manual Installation](docs/manual-installation.md) guide.

### Quick Sample

Replace `<GROUP_CALL_ID>` with your group id for your call, `<DISPLAY_NAME>` with your name, and `<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>` with your token. For full instructions check out our [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/ui-library/get-started-composites?tabs=kotlin&pivots=platform-ios) or get the completed [sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-ios-quickstarts/tree/main/ui-library-quick-start).

```swift
let callCompositeOptions = CallCompositeOptions()
let callComposite = CallComposite(withOptions: callCompositeOptions)
let communicationTokenCredential = try! CommunicationTokenCredential(token: "<USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>")
let remoteOptions = RemoteOptions(for: .groupCall(groupId: UUID("<GROUP_CALL_ID>")!),
                                  credential: communicationTokenCredential,
                                  displayName: "<DISPLAY_NAME>")
callComposite.launch(remoteOptions: remoteOptions)
```
