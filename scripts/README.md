## Main Repo Script
#### Details

The ```main-repo-updater.py ``` would perform version update for the following files:

2. make sure you have ```python3``` installed
3. run the command:
    - ```python3 main-repo-updater.py -c <COMPOSITE> -v <NEW_VERSION>``` or 
    - ```python3 main-repo-updater.py --composite <COMPOSITE> --version <NEW_VERSION>``` in your terminal
    - where ```<NEW_VERSION>``` should be the upcoming release version and `<COMPOSITE>` should be the type of composite with options of `calling` and `chat` (case insensitive).
     - the order of input arguments does not matter.
